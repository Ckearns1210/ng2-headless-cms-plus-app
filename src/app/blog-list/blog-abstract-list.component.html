    <p class="lead">Aries is the first sign of the zodiac, and that's pretty much how those born under this sign see themselves: first. Aries
        are the leaders of the pack, first in line to get things going. Whether or not everything gets done is another question
        altogether, for an Aries prefers to initiate rather than to complete. Do you have a project needing a kick-start?
        Call an Aries, by all means. The leadership displayed by Aries is most impressive, so don't be surprised if they
        can rally the troops against seemingly insurmountable odds.</p>

    <p>The symbol of Aries is the Ram, and that's both good and bad news. Impulsive Aries might be tempted to ram their ideas
        down everyone's throats without even bothering to ask if they want to know. It's these times when you may wish Aries'
        symbol were a more subdued creature, more lamb than ram perhaps. You're not likely to convince the Ram to soften
        up; these folks are blunt and to the point. Along with those qualities comes the sheer force of the Aries nature,
        a force that can actually accomplish a great deal. Much of Aries' drive to compete and to win comes from its Cardinal
        Quality. Cardinal Signs love to get things going, and Aries exemplifies this even better than Cancer, Libra or Capricorn.</p>

    <p class="lead">Taurus, the second sign of the zodiac, is all about reward. Unlike the Aries love of the game, Taurus loves the rewards
        of the game. Think physical pleasures and material goods, for those born under this sign revel in delicious excess.
        They are also a tactile lot, enjoying a tender, even sensual, touch. Taurus adores comfort and likes being surrounded
        by pleasing, soothing things. Along these lines, they also favor a good meal and a fine wine. The good life in all
        its guises, whether it's the arts or art of their own making (yes, these folks are artistic as well), is heaven on
        Earth to the Taurus-born.</p>

    <p>It's the Bull that serves as the Taurus's mascot, and along with that comes the expectation that these folks are bull-headed
        and stubborn. Yes, they are. Hey, this sign has a Fixed Quality attached to it after all, so expect that things will
        occasionally grind to a halt. That said, Taurus doesn√ït start out with the intention of getting stuck. They simply
        want to get things done, and it's that steady, dogged persistence that winds up being viewed as stubbornness. Bulls
        are actually among the most practical and reliable members of the zodiac, and they are happy to plod along, as it
        were, in pursuit of their goals. The good news for Bulls is that once they get to the finish line, they'll swaddle
        themselves in material goods. A self-indulgent beast? Perhaps, but if you toiled as laboriously as these folks do,
        you'd need some goodies, too.</p>
